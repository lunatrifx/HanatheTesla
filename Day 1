  - Tesla Model S Diecast (Blue)
	
Project Items (Not available as of 4/21)
	- 3.7V, x mAh Battery
	
Observations From Day One:
	- Tesla Model S Diecast is awaiting delivery (message from Tesla)
  - Motherboard was laid out flat with components and measured to see fit to diecast
  - Front motors may not reach front of diecast 
  - May have to relocate location for motherboard to center of car (just consideration)
  - By having Model S, more room in trunk for motherboard
  - Model S may need more brute force to enter internals

Procedure: 
	- Nothing significant to note 
  - Motherboard was laid flat with all motors and camera module attached
  - Model S awaiting delivery, just received notice from Tesla
	
Project Dimensions: (All measurements are in metric system)
	1) Tesla Model S
				- Length: 275mm
				- Width: 120mm
				- Height: 80mm
				- Weight: 1.25kg
	2) QX-171OYSZ-RX Motherboard:
				- Length: 57.15mm
				- Width: 50.8mm at longest point (camera module input)
				- Height: >1.59mm 
				
Brief Discussion:

Today is Earth Day but also the day HanatheTesla was officially logged as a working project. The Model S diecast is a little bit longer and wider than the 
Model 3, but it should do more benefit than harm for the project.
