# April 18, 2022: Day Zero for Tesla RC Car from Diecast #

Project: Hana the Tesla (Great Saphenous)

Project Lead: r/metmyecephali (pnickqlim/sinomoon)

--------------------------------------------Introduction----------------------------------------------

Project Items (As of 4/18)
	- Deconstructed Cloud Rider 2.0 Drone
	- Deconstructed camera module
	- Remote Control for Cloud Rider 2.0 Drone
	
Project Items (Not available as of 4.18)
	- 3.7V, x mAh Battery
	- Tesla Model S/3 Diecast
	
Observations From Day Zero:
	- Deconstruction of Cloud Rider 2.0 was difficult as it appeared wingtips were all saudered together
	- Almost all materials are readily available from the Cloud Rider 2.0
	- Drone has all four working motor sets, can draw plans for an AWD configuration of diecast
	- Drone's motherboard potentially small enough to fit the rear of 1:18 diecast without any invasive procedure
	- The drone had two sets of LEDs (2 White, 2 Red)

Procedure: 
	- I had to use box cutter heated by lighter to undo the saudering at wingtips
	- Organize screws holding down motherboard and LEDs
	- I had to create a 3d rendition on Autocad 360 Fusion to help me see it better

Brief Discussion:

I'm looking forward to building and leading the CodeHana project! It is my 4th annual project after CodeJxea, HepburnAUYHA, Jejubee and I hope to find
enjoyment in taking on my newest project for the 2022 season. I have confidence that drone parts will work and will at least give a RWD configuration.
However, I do have concerns that the diecast Model 3 or S will require brute force into the models to get into the axle and wire the motor into them. I
am also concerned about finding a new 3.7V battery module after Cloud Rider doesn't supply missing parts after years of ownership.
